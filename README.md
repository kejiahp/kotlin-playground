# Kotlin Playground

Code snippets written while learning kotlin.

#### Why is Kotlin being learnt, like why not just learn Java or C-Sharp

Kotlin is a cool language based on the JVM and has cool interoperability with Java and it generally has less bloat that Java.

I refuse to install C-Sharp (DotNet) on my computer, at-least for the mean time, till its needed.

Kotlin is an open-source programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and is primarily used to develop Android and server-side applications. It is an alternative to Java with simplified codes, better transparency, and productive programming. 


_*Real Reason*_: I need Kotlin for a school project involving android development and I've decided to use JetPack Compose. I shall not sully my hands with Android XML ðŸ˜‡.
